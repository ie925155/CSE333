  // You might find ::ReadFile() from HW2's fileparser.h useful
  // here.  Be careful, though; remember that it uses malloc to
  // allocate memory, so you'll need to use free() to free up that
  // memory.  Alternatively, you can use a unique_ptr with a malloc/free
  // deleter to automatically manage this for you; see the comment in
  // HttpUtils.h above the MallocDeleter class for details.
