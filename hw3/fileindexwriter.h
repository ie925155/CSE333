// Include the HW1 LinkedList and HashTable headers, and the HW2
// MemIndex and DocTable headers.  We'll need these to access the
// routines in the libhw1.a and libhw2.a libraries.  Note that those
// libraries were compiled with gcc, and therefore have "C"-style
// linkage.  Since fileindexwriter.cc is compiled by g++, we need
// do use 'extern "C"' to tell g++ that the routines accessed through
// these header files were compiled with g++.

// The WriteIndex() function writes the contents of a MemIndex and the

// Arguments:
//   - mi: the MemIndex to write into the index file.
//
//   - dt: the DocTable to write into the index file.
//
//   - filename: a C-style string containing the name of the index
//     file that we should create.
//
// Returns:
//   - the resulting size of the index file, in bytes, or 0 on error.
